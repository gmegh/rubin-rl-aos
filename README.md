# rubin-rl-aos

This incipient repository will allow you to set up the Rubin Observatory as an OpenAI Gym Environment. Instructions to set up all the packages to run the Rubin environment will follow soon.  

This code implements four RL benchmarks VPG, PPO, DDPG and SAC on the Rubin Observatory environment, to investigate how to learn how to control the active optics system.
